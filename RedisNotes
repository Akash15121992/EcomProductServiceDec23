1. Add @EnableCaching in the main class
2. Add @Cacheable annotation which we want to cache

@Cacheable(value = "product",key = "#id")

value ="product" -> giving name to value column in redis ,key name IS id.

1st -> 170ms ->17/18ms -> any keys || DB
make calls -> DB logs -> redis cache is not working
