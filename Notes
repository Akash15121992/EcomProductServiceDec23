DeSerialization -> Process of converting json string to an object .
Serialization -> Process of converting object to json string .


Standard industry process is that controller should only deal with DTOs
Controller -> Input DTO , Output -> DTO , Downstream (Service) -> DTO

Service -> Input -> DTO , Output ->  DTO  , Downstream (Repository) -> Entity
Service layer is the layer at which conversion from DTO to entity or entity to dto happens
as conversion can be part of business logic

Client -> Input -> DTO , Output -> DTO , everything is DTO.
Client is called by service layer .

Repository -> Input -> Entity ,Output -> Entity , DB saves entity only.

as conversion can be part of business logic
statistia (website for showing/rendering data based on plan you take). Three types of plan
1. free    -> shows 3 tabs
2. general -> shows 5 tabs
3. pro     -> shows 10 tabs

Standard industry process is that controller should only deal with DTOs

Previously Controller layer was calling mapper and converting DTO to entity and entity to DTO.
BUT now controller layer will deal with DTOs only and conversion will happen in service layer.

Exception Handling

We do not handle the exception by using throws or by try catch in controller or service layer

WE create a seperate package for exception and write all the code logic to handle the exception there
this process is called controlleradvice.

when controller throws the exception it does it according to the configuration , which class is marked with
@controlleradvice annotation.
Controller class whenever wants to throw an exception , it follows controlleradvice.

Need to create a response dto object class to respond back whenever an exception occurs.

For Smaller Projects with few controller and fewer methods , it is ok to have single controller advise

For Bigger Projects , with multiple controller and multiple methods , we need to have controller specific
controller advice classes.

ProductService  (Interface) -> FakeStoreProductServiceImpl , ProductServiceImpl we have two implementing
classes . We can multipe implementation of ProductService Interface like MongoDBPSImpl , AWSPsImpl

We want here in ProductController -> ProductService  (Interface) specific bean called ProductServiceImpl class
to be injected for that we have to use @qualifier annotation.

CID     ProductId       Price
1           1           10
2           2           20
1           3           30
1           4           40

total price for all the products for categoryID 1 -> 80

localhost:8080/category/price/id -> fetches all products for a given category id, and returns the sum of prices

@Before -> used for setting up test environment
 -- Before runs only once when we start executing the tests in the class.

@After -> used for destroying test environment
 -- After runs only once after executing the all the tests in the class.

@BeforeEach -> used for setting up for all test case
 -- BeforeEach before every test case

@AfterEach -> used for destroying for all test case
 -- AfterEach will run after every test case.

 ex

 We have 3 test cases in a class . Exceution of all annotation how many times.

 @Before         1
 @After          1
 @BeforeEach     3
 @AfterEach      3
